      </tfoot>
    </table>
    <!-- here i have made a tble of contents the tr tag represens the open and close of a row and td is the tag to make a collumn
    also you could ignore the different areas of the table and just use the open tag table and then row contents and ignore using things like <thead>
    the reason we would use things like <thead> and <tbody> is so we can style them seperately later! -->
